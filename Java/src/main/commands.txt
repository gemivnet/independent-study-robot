("s1", distance)

Stage 1 is when the robot originally looks to the left to make sure that there is a wall to the left of it.
The second parameter is the distance of the wall.

("c1")

Check 1 checks if the current distance of S1 is greater than the previous distance of S1. If this check is true,
movement from the robot can be expected.

("c2")

Check 2 checks if the distance of S1 is less than 7. If this check is true, movement from the robot
can be expected.

("s2")

The robot will now move forward. A movement command is expected during this stage.

("s3", distance)

Stage two moves the servo to point the camera ahead of the robot to check for obstacles. The second parameter is 
the distance in front of the robot. If this distance is less than the trigger distance a movement command will occur.
